<h2>Running ToolsUI</h2>
<h3>Download and run locally</h3>

<p>You can download the toolsUI.jar from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the <a href="/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp">netCDF Download page</a>, or</li>
    <li>the <a href="documentation.htm">netCDF-Java documentation page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can then run the ToolsUI application using a command similar to this:</p>

<code>java -Xmx1g -jar toolsUI.jar</code>

<h2>Check that netCDF-Java can open your dataset</h2>

<p>The netCDF-Java library can read data from a wide range of scientific data formats
    (more details <a href="reference/formats/FileTypes.html">here</a>). To check that
    your dataset can be read by netCDF-Java, use the "Viewer" tab in ToolsUI. Either
    cut-and-paste a URL or file path into the "dataset" field or click on the folder
    icon and select a file. (If you cut-and-paste, you will need to hit "Enter" to open
    the dataset.)
</p>
<p>If the dataset can be opened, you will see the dimensions, variables, and other
    details listed in the ToolsUI window. E.g.,</p>

<h2>Check that netCDF-Java recognizes your dataset as gridded data</h2>

<p>The netCDF-Java library can recognize various kinds of gridded datasets (e.g.,
    a netCDF-CF compliant gridded file or GRIB data). To check that your dataset is
    recognized as gridded data, use the "FeatureType -> Gridded" tab in ToolsUI. Either
    cut-and-paste a URL or file path into the "dataset" field or click on the folder
    icon and select a file. (If you cut-and-paste, you will need to hit "Enter" to open
    the dataset.)
</p>

<p>If the dataset is recognized as containing gridded data, the ToolsUI window will
    show three tables containing (from the top table down) gridded fields, coordinate
    systems, and axes. E.g.,</p>
